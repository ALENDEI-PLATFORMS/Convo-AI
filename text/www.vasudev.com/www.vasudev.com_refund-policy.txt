    RETURN, EXCHANGE, CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY




We understand. We have a great service, exclusive, and services which sort of tools you want to try. So do it! Try us risk-free with our Any Time Money Back Guarantee.


The thing is, we don’t think you’ll be canceling. If you do decide we’re not the right service provider for you though, we’ll give you a hassle-free refund. We may have to stock up on tissues if you cancel though because we hate break-ups, but we promise, no hard feelings. Just cancel your account within your first 30-days for a full refund, or anytime after for a prorated refund of unused service after 30-days. It’s that easy.



We don't want any customers to leave, but if you do we think you'll be back. Once you get used to our solid team, ultra-reliable servers and ease of use, those other guys just won't cut it.


  We Want To Make Things Right!



If you’re unhappy for any reason, let us know why. Our friendly support team is standing by.



Now here's the boring policy details (sorry, we have to!):



If a request is submitted online for immediate cancellation within the first 30 days, a full refund will be issued.



Customers who desire a refund on a prepaid account after 30-days will be re-billed at the regular price as opposed to any discounted price from the use of a coupon. Only the difference between the prepaid amount and the re-billed regular price will be refunded. Refund requests received after 120 days have passed since the original payment transaction is 120 days old. Refunds are not offered for partial months of service. Accounts that are terminated due to Terms of Service violations are not eligible for a refund. Service credits have no cash value.


Please let us know if there is anything we can do to keep you as our customer before you.

Write to us for refunds at care@vasudev.com and we will initiate necessary process to refund your money within 30 days. You will be responsible to bear necessary charges charged by financial institutions for the refund.
